# Set up iOS device access to your company resources

Enroll your iOS device with the Intune Company Portal app to gain secure access to your organization's email, files, and apps.

Before you're allowed to access proprietary data from a coporate or personal device, you're required to get your device managed. After your device becomes managed, your organization will assign policies and apps to the device through their mobile device management (MDM) provider. 

To maintain access to work or school information from your device, you must configure your device to match your organization's preferred settings. This article describes how Company Portal helps you enroll, configure, and maintain your device to meet these requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> If you tried to access company email in the Mail app, and received a prompt to get your device managed, you're in the right place. Follow the instructions below to get access to your email and other company resources on your iOS device.

## What to expect from the Company Portal app

### Security
During initial setup, the app requires that you authenticate yourself with your organization. It then informs you of any device settings you must update. For example, organizations often set minimum or maximum character password requirements that you'll be required to meet.    

### Protection
After your device is enrolled, the Company Portal app will continue to make sure that your device is protected. If you install an app from an untrusted source, for example, the app will alert you and sometimes revoke access to company data. App protection policies like this one are common in organizations. They often require you to uninstall the untrusted app before you can regain access.

### Setting notifications
If after enrollment your organization enforces a new security requirement, such as multi-factor authentication, the Company Portal app will notify you. You'll have the chance to adjust your settings so that you can continue to work from your device.  

To learn more about enrollment, see [What happens when I install the Company Portal app and enroll my device?](https://docs.microsoft.com//intune-user-help/what-happens-if-you-install-the-company-portal-app-and-enroll-your-device-in-intune-ios). 

## Before you start

- Once you begin enrollment, make sure that you finish the entire process. If you pause for more than a few minutes, setup may end and require you to start over.  
- If this process should fail, return to the Company Portal app and try again.  
- Check that your Wi-Fi is working, and that Safari works on your device.
- Download and install the [Intune Company Portal app](install-and-sign-in-to-the-intune-company-portal-app-ios.md).
